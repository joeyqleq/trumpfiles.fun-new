# About The Trump Files (TL;DR)

**The Trump Files** is a public archive documenting **377+ verified incidents** of Donald Trump being Donald Trump—the lying, grifting, racist, authoritarian man-child we've been stuck with for 40 years.

## Why This Exists: Three Reasons

### 1. **The Ledger** (So We Remember This Shit ⚖️)
Every day with Trump is 15 scandals deep. If we don't write it down, we forget the coup attempt from last week because he suggested drinking bleach *this* week. This is the historical record with timestamps, sources, and receipts.

### 2. **The Science** (Turning Chaos Into Data 📉)
Every entry is scored across **8 behavioral dimensions** (Insanity, Danger, Absurdity, etc.) and linked to related incidents. The database reveals patterns machines can analyze: escalation timelines, rhetoric-to-violence arcs, grift evolution.

```

pie title Trump's Core Personality Breakdown
"Narcissism" : 35
"Grift" : 25
"Racism" : 15
"Compulsive Lying" : 15
"Spray Tan" : 10

```

### 3. **The Comedy** (Because If You Don't Laugh, You'll Cry 🎭)
The man bankrupted a casino, thinks windmills cause cancer, and once suggested nuking hurricanes. He's a walking punchline who somehow got nuclear codes. Twice.

## The 40-Year Trump Show  🔥 🔥 🔥

We've watched him cycle through masks:
- **1970s**: Racist landlord (sued by DOJ)
- **1980s**: Failed casino mogul
- **2000s**: Reality TV grifter
- **2016**: "Outsider" populist (who immediately sold out)
- **2021**: Attempted coup (failed, cried about it)
- **2025**: Full fascist (taking $100M bribes, breaking Constitution daily)

Same playbook every time: **lie, deny, attack, play victim, never apologize**.

---

## How It Works

- **Data source**: Multi-agent AI research across major news, fact-checkers, government docs, social archives
- **Selection criteria**: Must be verifiable, significant, absurd/dangerous, and pattern-relevant
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL + pgvector for semantic search
- **Scoring**: 8-dimension ratings with AI baseline + human calibration

---

## What You Get

- **Search**: keyword or semantic ("election subversion," "violent threats")
- **Filters**: by year, category, severity
- **Visualizations**: timeline heatmaps, cluster maps, rhetoric evolution graphs
- **Community voting** (soon): adjust scores, submit sources, flag patterns

## What This Proves

C --> D[Coup Attempt 2021]
D --> E[Full Fascism 2025]

```

Escalation is measurable. Chaos is strategy. Impunity breeds boldness.

## Who This Helps

- **Voters**: context beyond headlines 👊 
- **Researchers**: structured, citable data 👊 
- **Journalists**: pattern recognition 👊 
- **Comedy writers**: infinite material 👊 
- **Anyone who's tired of gaslighting**: here are the receipts 👊

## The Tone

Yes, we call Trump a narcissist, liar, and fascist. **Because he is. ⚠️ **

But every claim is **sourced**. Every score is **explained**. Every pattern is **demonstrable**.

We're not making it up—we're just refusing to pretend it's normal.

---

**The Trump Files**: Because if we don't document the absurdity, we'll forget how insane this actually was.
