# What the Fuck are Trump Files?

Welcome to the internet's most comprehensive attempt to document **the single most absurd, dangerous, and fascinating human being** to ever stumble into the presidency—twice. 

For over 40 years, we've watched Donald J. Trump cycle through masks: the "self-made" real estate grifter (he wasn't), the reality TV carnival barker (that one was real), the political outsider (with decades of corruption experience), and now, the full-blown authoritarian fascist openly breaking the Constitution like it's a prenup.

He's a **racist**, **sexist**, **compulsive liar**, and according to pretty much every psychologist who's watched him, a **textbook malignant narcissist**. He's got the attention span of a goldfish on Adderall, the vocabulary of a third-grader, and the impulse control of a toddler with a flamethrower. And yet—*and yet*—he's somehow convinced millions of people that *he's* the victim, the genius, the only one who can save America from... whatever fever dream he cooked up that morning.

This archive exists because **every single day with Trump is a five-alarm dumpster fire**, and if we don't write it down, we'll forget half of it by Wednesday.

## Why The Trump Files Exists: The Three Hats

### 🎩 Hat #1: The Archive (So We Don't Forget This Shit Actually Happened)

This is the **encyclopedia, the ledger, the crime log, the receipts**. 

Because Trump operates on a simple principle: say 47 insane things on Monday so people forget the coup attempt from Friday. Flood the zone with so much chaos that tracking it becomes impossible. Normalize the absurd by making it constant.

The Trump Files is the antidote to that strategy. Every lie, every scam, every batshit press conference, every $100 million bribe (thanks Miriam Adelson!), every time he charged the Secret Service $17,000/month to use bathrooms in his own hotel—**it's here, timestamped, sourced, and scored**.

This is the historical record for when people inevitably say "it wasn't that bad" or "I don't remember that." Yes you do. It's right here. With citations.

### 🔬 Hat #2: The Science (Turning Chaos Into Data)

This isn't just a list—it's a **structured behavioral database** built for analysis.

Every entry is tagged, categorized, scored across eight dimensions (Insanity, Absurdity, Danger, Authoritarianism, Lawlessness, etc.), and linked to related incidents. Why? So machines can read it. So researchers can query it. So we can actually **see the patterns** instead of drowning in anecdotes.

```

flowchart TB
A[Trump Says/Does Something Insane] --> B{Is It Verifiable?}
B -->|Yes| C[Add to Database]
B -->|No| D[Monitor for Confirmation]
C --> E[Score Across 8 Dimensions]
E --> F[Link to Related Entries]
F --> G[Generate Visualizations]
G --> H[Reveal Escalation Patterns]
H --> I[Public Can Search \& Analyze]

```

We're turning 40 years of Trump into machine-readable patterns so you can ask questions like:
- "When did his racist rhetoric shift from dog-whistles to explicit calls for ethnic cleansing?"
- "How many times did he threaten to jail political opponents before actually trying it?"
- "Show me the escalation from 'I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue' to January 6th."

And the database answers with timelines, heatmaps, and network graphs.

### 😂 Hat #3: The Comedy (Because If You Don't Laugh, You'll Scream)

Look—Trump is a **walking SNL sketch** who somehow got nuclear codes.

He suggests injecting bleach to cure COVID. He stares directly at a solar eclipse. He thinks windmills cause cancer. He draws on a hurricane map with a Sharpie and insists he was right. He does the accordion hands. He makes that face—you know the one, the pouting, lip-pursed, "I'm a very stable genius" face.

The man is **70% grift, 20% dementia, 10% spray tan**, and he's been getting away with it for decades because he's somehow both terrifying and ridiculous at the same time.

So yeah, this archive is also a **monument to the absurd**. Because sometimes you have to laugh at the sheer audacity of a guy who:
- Bankrupted a casino (how do you lose money when people literally hand it to you??)
- Claimed bone spurs to dodge Vietnam, then said avoiding STDs was "my personal Vietnam"
- Paid $130,000 in hush money to a porn star and then sued her for defamation
- Got impeached twice and still thinks he's the most persecuted president in history

If we don't document the comedy, we lose sight of how **spectacularly unqualified** this man has always been. 👊

## The Trump Phenomenon: 40 Years of Masks

We've been watching this trainwreck since the **1970s**, when he and his father were sued for racist housing discrimination. Even back then, the playbook was the same:
1. Do the crime
2. Deny everything
3. Attack the accuser
4. Claim victimhood
5. Never admit fault
6. Repeat

Over the decades, Trump has worn **different masks** depending on what scam he was running: 🌍

- **1970s-80s: The Real Estate Con Man** — Inherits $400 million, pretends he's self-made, bankrupts casinos, scams contractors
- **1990s-2000s: The Celebrity Grifter** — Reality TV star, "you're fired," sells steaks and vodka and a fake university
- **2010s: The Birther Racist** — Launches political career by lying about Obama's birth certificate (surprised? you shouldn't be)
- **2016: The "Outsider" Populist** — Runs on draining the swamp, immediately fills it with his own sludge
- **2017-2021: The Wannabe Dictator** — Praises every authoritarian on Earth, tries a coup, fails, whines about it forever
- **2025: The Full Fascist** — Wins re-election, openly breaks the Constitution, takes bribes, purges agencies, threatens violence, and his base cheers

And through all of it, the **core personality never changed**: explosive narcissist, pathological liar, bigot, coward, and con artist.

The scary part? **It's working.** The man literally attempted a coup and got re-elected. He's taking $100 million from oligarchs, gutting the EPA, threatening to jail journalists, and half the country shrugs.

That's why this archive exists. Because **normalization is the weapon**, and documentation is the defense.

## How This Works (The Boring But Important Part)

### Data Collection: Multi-Agent AI Research
We used **Perplexity AI's Deep Research mode** to crawl thousands of sources across:
- Major news (NPR, Washington Post, NYTimes, BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera)
- Fact-checkers (PolitiFact, Snopes, FactCheck.org)
- Government records (DOJ indictments, Congressional testimony, FDA warnings)
- Social media archives (Trump Twitter Archive, Truth Social)
- Academic research (behavioral studies, Project 2025 docs)

Each incident was cross-verified, timestamped, and scored by AI agents with human oversight on edge cases.

### Entry Selection: How Things Make the Cut
Not every Trump tweet makes the list. To get in, an entry must pass:

| Criteria | Threshold |
|----------|-----------|
| **Verifiability** | ≥2 independent sources or 1 primary doc |
| **Significance** | Measurable public/institutional impact |
| **Absurdity/Danger** | Breaks norms, endangers public, or corrodes systems |
| **Pattern Relevance** | Links to existing behavioral clusters |

We reject trivia and unverified gossip. Only the **high-grade crazy** makes it through.

### The Eight Scoring Dimensions
Each entry gets rated 0-10 across:

```

graph LR
A[Entry] --> B[Insanity Score]
A --> C[Absurdity Score]
A --> D[Danger Score]
A --> E[Authoritarianism Score]
A --> F[Lawlessness Score]
A --> G[Credibility Risk Score]
A --> H[Recency Intensity Score]
A --> I[Impact Scope Score]

    B --> J[Composite Score]
    C --> J
    D --> J
    E --> J
    F --> J
    G --> J
    H --> J
    I --> J
    ```

**Example**: "Injecting Bleach" briefing (April 2020)
- Insanity: 10/10 (suggested poison as medicine on live TV)
- Absurdity: 10/10 (no president has ever done this)
- Danger: 10/10 (poison control calls spiked immediately)
- Impact: 10/10 (global mockery, public health crisis)
- **Composite: 9.8/10**

### Storage & Search: PostgreSQL + Vector Embeddings
All 377+ entries live in **Neon PostgreSQL** with:
- Relational tables (entries, sources, keywords, reactions)
- **pgvector extension** for semantic search (find "election interference" even if those exact words aren't used)
- Hybrid search (keywords + meaning) for precision

You can filter by year, category, severity threshold, or ask natural language questions like "show me grift escalation from 2016-2025."

---

## What You Can Do Here

### Search & Filter
- Keyword or semantic search ("weaponizing DOJ," "violent rhetoric")
- Filter by category, year, severity, affected institutions
- Sort by composite score or individual dimensions

### Visualizations
- **Timeline heatmap**: severity spikes over decades
- **Cluster map**: communities of related incidents (election subversion, grift, racism)
- **Rhetoric tracker**: how language evolved from innuendo to explicit threats
- **Institution damage grid**: which branches (courts, Congress, EPA) got attacked and when

### Community Voting (Coming Soon)
- Vote on severity scores (agree with AI assessment or adjust)
- Submit additional sources and context
- Flag connections we missed

---

## What This Reveals

- **Escalation is real**: Trump went from petty housing discrimination to literal coup attempts in a measurable arc
- **Rhetoric predicts action**: spikes in dehumanizing language precede policy moves and violence
- **Impunity breeds boldness**: every time he gets away with something, the next crime is bigger
- **Chaos is strategy**: the volume of incidents isn't a bug, it's the feature—overwhelm, normalize, repeat

---

## Who This Helps

| Audience | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **Researchers** | Structured, citable data with scoring and link graphs |
| **Journalists** | Pattern recognition beyond single headlines |
| **Voters** | Clear documentation of behavior, not spin |
| **Educators** | Teaching authoritarianism with real-world examples |
| **Mental Health Pros** | Case study in narcissistic pathology at scale |
| **Comedy Writers** | Endless material (sadly) |

---

## Roadmap

- **Public API**: programmatic access for researchers and apps
- **Advanced visualizations**: interactive escalation graphs, network maps
- **Semantic chat**: ask questions, get cited answers from the database
- **Community scoring**: crowd-weighted severity dimensions
- **Research export**: academic citation packs with embeddings

---

## Disclaimers & Guardrails

- **Yes, this is biased**: toward facts, receipts, and not gaslighting ourselves
- **Scoring is subjective**: but transparent, explainable, and auditable
- **Not every Trump moment is here**: we focus on significance, not completeness
- **Disagreements are welcome**: submit counter-evidence and we'll review

If you think documenting Trump's 30,573 documented lies, multiple coup attempts, and daily constitutional violations is "partisan," this site isn't for you. For everyone else: **the receipts are hyperlinked**.

---

## A Note on Tone

Yes, this is irreverent. Yes, we call Trump a narcissist, a liar, and a fascist. Because *he is*. 

But every claim is **sourced**. Every score is **explained**. Every pattern is **demonstrable**.

We're not making this up. We're just refusing to pretend it's normal.

---

**The Trump Files**: Because democracy dies in darkness, but fascism thrives in chaos—and we're bringing every single receipt.
